#### üîó Connectivity
- **`src/components/WalletConnector.tsx`**: Web3 wallet integration with RainbowKit
- **`src/providers/RainbowKitProvider.tsx`**: Blockchain connectivity provider

## üéÆ How It Works

### 1. **Wallet Connection & Initialization**
Users connect their Web3 wallet through RainbowKit integration. The system initializes the Midnight MCP wallet for privacy-preserving operations and registers with the multi-agent system.

### 2. **Policy Definition**
Users define treasury management policies in natural language (e.g., "I want a conservative policy focused on 60% stablecoin yield and low volatility"). The AI interprets these policies into executable parameters.

### 3. **Autonomous Analysis Cycle**
The multi-agent system continuously runs analysis cycles:
- **Market Monitor** gathers current market data and sentiment
- **Financial Analyst** analyzes portfolio performance and generates rebalancing proposals
- **Risk Manager** validates proposals against risk parameters
- **Compliance Checker** ensures regulatory compliance
- **Execution Engine** prepares for trade execution

### 4. **Proposal Generation & Voting**
AI-generated proposals are presented to DAO members for voting. Votes are cast using zero-knowledge proofs to maintain privacy while ensuring verifiability.

### 5. **Automated Execution**
Approved proposals are automatically executed through the Execution Engine, using shielded transactions on the Midnight network to maintain privacy.

### 6. **Continuous Monitoring**
The system continuously monitors portfolio performance, market conditions, and risk metrics, adjusting strategies as needed.

## üîç Multi-Agent System Monitor Workflow

The Multi-Agent System Monitor provides real-time visibility into the autonomous agent network:

### Backend Workflow (Agent Communication)
1. **Agent Registration**: Each agent registers with the communication system, advertising capabilities and endpoints
2. **Service Discovery**: Agents discover available services through the marketplace registry
3. **Task Assignment**: The orchestrator assigns tasks based on agent capabilities and current workload
4. **Inter-Agent Messaging**: Agents communicate using encrypted messages through the communication layer
5. **Status Monitoring**: Continuous heartbeat monitoring ensures agent availability
6. **Result Aggregation**: Task results are collected and processed for decision-making

### Frontend Visualization
- **Real-time Agent Status**: Live display of each agent's current status (online, busy, offline)
- **Communication Log**: Stream of inter-agent messages and coordination activities  
- **Task Progress**: Visual representation of ongoing tasks and their completion status
- **System Health**: Overall system status and performance metrics
- **Emergency Controls**: Manual intervention capabilities for critical situations
